# React + Vite

this project is a simple calculator, it considred as my first project after learning a bit about React JS.

i managed to challenge my self to implement dark/light consept without watching a toturial or using chatGpt or any eternal help and 
As a first project i didn't face strugles that took me a lot of time, but still i learned that stuff like even if i am working on my own code, it good to use comments otherwise you might lost in your own code. It happend for me so it is a valuable lesson .

although the colour i used aren't well studied, i am aiming to improve myself on the UI/UX in the future 

I hosted it on Netlfy https://calculatorbyi.netlify.app/
